                      name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following
                      deviations from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in the

                      respected because ports are not allowed. \n Incoming requests

                        the RFC: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. The `:` delimiter is
                        not respected because ports are not allowed. \n Incoming requests
                        are matched against the hostnames before the HTTPRoute rules.
                        If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on the
                        HTTPRouteRules. \n Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a
                        domain name without the terminating dot of a network host
                        (e.g. \"foo.example.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain
                        name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.example.com\").
                        The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first
                        DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have
                        a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests
                        will be matched against the Host field in the following order:
                        1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if    the
                        http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard,
                        then the request matches this rule if    the http host header
                        is to equal to the suffix    (removing the first label) of
                        the wildcard rule. \n Support: Core"
